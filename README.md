# Exploring Conversion Rate Trends by Income, Spending, and Age
 This analysis examines the relationship between income, spending, and age in determining conversion rates. It begins with feature engineering to extract key insights, including age, parental status, spending patterns, campaign interactions, transactions, and conversion rate (responses/visits). Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), scatter plots reveal trends between income, age, and conversion rates. Finally, clustering is applied to segment users based on their behavior, enabling more precise targeting of high-conversion groups.
